rm removes each file specified on the command line. By default, it does not remove directories.
When rm is executed with the -r or -R options, it recursively deletes any matching directories, their subdirectories, and all files they contain.
General syntax ------ rm [OPTION]... [FILE]...
Options 
-f, --force ignore nonexistent files and arguments, never prompt
-i     prompt before every removal
-d, --dir remove empty directories


Part 2

As a Computer Science and Information Security student, I understnad the worth of practical knowledge in this field. 
Even though I study at a college, unfortunately, I can not say that I get enough practical knowledge to be confident in my skills. 
The main reason to participate in this boot camp, is boosting my knowledge and skills in cybersecurity. 
In future I see my career in IT and I would like to have enough practical skills to find a job matching to my interests and knowledge.
In general I am mostly interested in offensive and defensive cyber security. At the end of this boot camp, I would like to be able to perform pen. testing, website hacking and so on.
